btscale - bluetooth LE scales from Javascript
=============================================

Uses the `chrome.bluetoothLowEnergy` APIs for accessing the Acaia
scale.  Currently tested using mobile-chrome-apps on Android + iOS -
should work on ChromeOS devices as well.  Support for this API is
underway for OSX, when completed this library should work on the
desktop as well.
